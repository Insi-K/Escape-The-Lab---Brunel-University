# Escape The Lab - Brunel University
This is a Game prototype I presented as my final year project for university.

By making use of game design concepts and methodologies, I designed and developed a small demo of a 2D platform game, inspired in other published titles such as Superfighters and Duck Game.

This game was exported as a web based game and as a program executable. You can either download the game from this repository or test it via the following link: https://insi-k.itch.io/escape-the-lab.
